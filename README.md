# Election_Analysis #
## Overview of Election Audit ##
### Purpose ###
	The purpose of this project is to deliver an election analysis on what county had the most votes, which candidate has the most votes, winning percentage differentiation and largest turn out. We were given raw data based on ballots votes, mail-in votes etc.

## Election ##
### Audit Results ###
	Results consist of 3 counties and 3 different candidates but only one candidate can persevere above them all. According to our analysis the county that provided the most votes was Denver which accounted for 83% of the overall votes between the 3 counties. Diana DeGette was awarded the title with a 74% (272k out of 369k) vote percentage.

### Summary ###
	Diana DeGette is our declared winner by a large margin. Thus, the script we've written can be applied to any election raw data regardless of the amount of counties or candidates no modification needed. For any other desired output will require script modification.
